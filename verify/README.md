This directory contains an experimental project for formally verifying Rust-like code.
It is currently unfinished and under construction.
See [Goals](../../../wiki/Goals) for a brief description of the project's goals.

# Building the project

The project root directory contains the following subdirectories:

```
.github
compiler
library
src
verify
```

All but the `verify` subdirectory come from the Rust compiler's public
repository.  Thus far, we have made only minor modifications to the Rust
compiler, primarily to add additional hooks for the verification code.  See
[Code.md] for more details about files in the `verify` directory.  See the
[official docs](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/) for more about the
normal Rust compiler.

## Step 1: build Rust

Start in the project root directory.
Create a `config.toml` file based on `config.toml.verify`, and run `x.py install`:

```
cp config.toml.verify config.toml
python x.py install
```

Running `x.py install` creates both a `build` and an `install` directory in the project root directory:

```
.github
build
compiler
install
library
src
verify
```

All the installation goes into the project `install` directory;
nothing is installed outside the project directory
(see `prefix = "install"` in `config.toml.verify` for details).

Note: this first step may take more than an hour, since the Rust source code is large, but all other steps are fast.

## Step 2: copy the Z3 libraries into install directory

Download the [Z3 binaries](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases).
The Z3 `bin` folder contain the libraries `libz3.*`.
The easiest way to make these libraries available to the build is to copy them into the `install` directory.
For example,

on Windows:

```
cp /z3/bin/libz3.lib install/lib/rustlib/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/lib
cp /z3/bin/libz3.dll install/bin
```

on Darwin (Mac):

```
curl -O -L https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases/download/z3-4.8.10/z3-4.8.10-x64-osx-10.15.7.zip
unzip z3-4.8.10-x64-osx-10.15.7.zip
cp z3-4.8.10-x64-osx-10.15.7/bin/libz3.a install/lib/rustlib/x86_64-apple-darwin/lib/.
cp z3-4.8.10-x64-osx-10.15.7/bin/libz3.dylib install/lib/rustlib/x86_64-apple-darwin/lib/.
cp z3-4.8.10-x64-osx-10.15.7/bin/z3 install/bin/.
rm -R z3-4.8.10-x64-osx-10.15.7
rm z3-4.8.10-x64-osx-10.15.7.zip
```

## Step 3: build the verifier

First, go to the `verify` subdirectory:

```
cd verify
```

Then use `cargo` to build the verifier:

```
../install/bin/cargo build
```

On Darwin (and likely Linux), if you have other toolchains installed (with rustup), you'll need instead:

```
RUSTC=../install/bin/rustc ../install/bin/cargo build
```

This will build four crates:
- three crates that constitute the verifier:
    - AIR (assertion intermediate language):
      an intermediate language based on assert and assume statements,
      which is translated into SMT queries for Z3
    - VIR (verification intermediate language):
      a simplified subset of Rust,
      which is translated into AIR
    - rust_verify, which contains a `main` function that runs Rust and translates
      the Rust intermediate representation into VIR
- one crate that contains built-in definitions used by code being verified:
    - builtin

# Running the verifier 

After running the build steps above, you can verify an example file.
From the `verify` directory, run:

on Windows:

```
../install/bin/rust_verify rust_verify/example/recursion.rs -L ../install/bin/
```

on Darwin (and likely Linux):

```
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=../install/lib/rustlib/x86_64-apple-darwin/lib LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../install/lib ../install/bin/rust_verify rust_verify/example/recursion.rs -L ../install/bin/
```

You can also use the helper script:

```
./tools/rust-verify.sh rust_verify/example/recursion.rs
```

This runs the `Rust --> VIR --> AIR --> Z3` pipeline on `recursion.rs`
and reports the errors that Z3 finds.

The `-L ../install/bin/` is used to link to the `builtin` crate.

# Editing the source code

Before committing any changes to the source code,
make sure that it conforms to the `rustfmt` tool's guidelines.
We are using the default `rustfmt` settings from the Rust repository.
To check the source code, type the following from the `verify` directory:

```
../install/bin/cargo-fmt -- --check
```

If you have other toolchains installed (with `rustup`) this will run the active
toolchain by default, and not the `rust-fmt` that we compiled with the `rust` compiler.

To switch to the correct tools, you can add the custom toolchain to `rustup`, and set an
override for this project:

```
cd ..
# In the project root:
rustup toolchain link rust-verify install/
rustup override set rust-verify
```

If the source code follows the guidelines, `cargo-fmt -- --check` will produce no output.
Otherwise, it will report suggestions on how to reformat the source code.

To automatically apply these suggestions to the source code, type:

```
../install/bin/cargo-fmt
```

# Documentation

Commenting the code is *strongly encouraged*!  Use `///` to create comments
that [`rustdoc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html) can
automatically extract into HTML documentation.

You can compile the current documentation by running (in the `verify` directory)
```
RUSTC=../install/bin/rustc RUSTDOC=../install/bin/rustdoc ../install/bin/cargo doc 
```
which will produce documentation files, e.g., `./target/doc/rust_verify/index.html`

# Running tests for the rust to vir translation, and inspecting the resulting vir/air/smt

`cargo test` will run the tests for `rust_verify`,

```
RUSTC=../install/bin/rustc ../install/bin/cargo test -p rust_verify
```

As discussed above, you may only need the RUSTC variable on Darwin/Linux.

You can run a single test file and a specific test within with the following:

```
RUSTC=../install/bin/rustc ../install/bin/cargo test -p rust_verify --test <test file> <test name>
```

See the cargo help for more info on the test flags.

If you'd like to inspect the vir/air/smt produced by a test, you can provide a target directory path as an
environment variable, `VERIFY_LOG_IR_PATH`.
You should only run a single test, as only the latest logged IR is preserved.
For example, the following will emit the vir/air/smt logs to `rust_verify/logs`:

```
VERIFY_LOG_IR_PATH="logs" RUSTC=../install/bin/rustc ../install/bin/cargo test -p rust_verify --test refs_basic test_struct_ref
```

@utaal has not yet figured out how to determine what test is currently running, to enable running
an entire file/suite and have the resulting logs organized by file/test name.
